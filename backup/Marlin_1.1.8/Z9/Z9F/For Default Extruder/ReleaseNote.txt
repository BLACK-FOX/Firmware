V1.1
======================================================
Add a string on the LCD screen to show the filament run out sensor state 

V2.0
======================================================
Add "firmware retraction" to improve the string issue, there are 2 method to apply it.
1. if the slicing software support firmware retraction feature, you can set the firmware retraction command "G10 for retraction and G11 for recover"
2. if the slicing software doesn't support firwmware retraction feature, you can add a "M209 S1" commamd in the start code, it will convert the retraction to a "firmware retraction" feature. You can enable it on the LCD MENU too.
MENU>>Control>>Retract

PS: you can set the below setting of Retraction on LCD MENU.
AutoRetr.    >> Enable or disable firmware retraction
Retract mm   >> Retraction lenght
Retract V:   >> Retraction speedd (mm/s)
Hop mm:      >> Z hop height when retract
UnRet mm:    >> Recover lenght after retracted
UnRet V:     >> Recover speed
